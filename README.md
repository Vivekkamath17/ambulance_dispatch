üöë QuickResponse: Emergency Dispatch System
This project is a multi-page, role-based front-end application for a modern emergency medical dispatch platform. It utilizes a cohesive dark navy theme and responsive design principles, implemented entirely with HTML, CSS (Tailwind CDN), and vanilla JavaScript.

The application provides distinct interfaces for Public Users, Ambulance Drivers, and Dispatchers, tied together by a central login system.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
HTML5: Structural Markup

CSS3: Custom styling for visual consistency

Tailwind CSS (CDN): Used for rapid, modern, utility-first styling across all pages.

Vanilla JavaScript: Used for dynamic functionality, form validation, and complex dashboard state management (e.g., active trips, availability toggles, form switching).

Font Awesome: Used for all icons across the project.

‚ú® Key Design Principles & Features
1. Consistent Styling
All pages adhere to a single, professional dark navy (#1f253e) theme with primary red (#f44336) accents. The navigation bar is sticky across all marketing pages for easy access to the "Request Ambulance" button.

2. Multi-Role Authentication
The login.html file implements dynamic logic to handle the three primary user types:

Login: Simulates authentication and redirects the user to their respective dashboard based on a determined role.

Sign Up: Displays conditional form fields (e.g., medical info for Patients, license details for Drivers, and employee IDs for Dispatchers) based on the role selection.

3. Dynamic Dashboards (JavaScript-Powered)
